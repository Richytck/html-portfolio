    My name is Richard. Im a student who wants to learn the fantastic skill of
    web developing and potentially some programming later along the road.
    Internet is a mysterious place, full of information provided by knowledgable
    and skilled people. More often this valuable information can be accessible
    for free. As at this time putting information on this page I have been
    undergoing multiple online course materials from Uldemy and learning ton of
    particular web developer skills. I'm truly having a blast unlocking
    knowledge. Its so bizarre seeing the progress I have at this point. Its
    motivating to the core.

    I was born in the city of Liepaja, located in beautiful country Latvia. When
    I was younger I made a decision to move to United Kingdom to learn new
    culture and pick up english skills. I gave myself 6 month with a plan to go
    back to Latvia. I fell in love in UK in first week, it was so different,
    people were talking different language. Road and Shop signs was in English.
    It was like a arrived on different planet. Everything was so interesting and
    exiting, meeting new people and trying to communicate with them in the most
    awkward way. England change my life completely. 18 years later I have built
    a family, married the greatest women and becoming a father of 3 children.
    Moved 3 different cities and tried multiple different carriers along the
    way.

    I have been tinkering with computers for more then 20 years now, starting
    playing video games (kinda still do when I got time) but later I was more
    interested of building them, learning different programs and picking up
    design skills like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and later Premier Pro for
    video editing for our family vlog YouTube channel. I was interested to
    dissect games and programs and see how they were created. I found passion to
    custom files and sources to mess with the original projects and later on
    creating and hosting different game servers. I was always interested in
    technical side of computing. So next step in my journey is to pick up some
    html,css and jscript skills so I can proceed further in my carrier of
    hopefully becoming employed by a firm and work a job that I actually enjoy.
    Its still a journey but I really enjoy these small steps, I can see the
    horizon in distance and hopefully I will see the land eventually. If you
    have read this so far, I'm thanking you and if you are someone who wishes to
    pick up new skill, don't be discouraged. It will be worth it at the end.
